<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've imitated IOS Calculator by using DOM. For this purpose;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First I've created a grid layout to place buttons, screen etc. and for styling I've used SASS,</li>
  <li>I've grouped the buttons according to their functionality, within this context I've created arrays named "digits", "operands" and "others" and at each click  </li>
  <li>Capturing method was used for detecting which key was clicked,</li>
  <li>Defined variables by using DOM querySelector etc. ,</li>
  <li>Navigated through DOM elements by using commands like getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll, parentElement etc.,</li>
  <li>If calculation starts with "." code converts that to "0.",</li>
  <li>It's possible to make consecutive calculations. When you click "+", "-", "x", "Ã·" buttons, if there was a previous operation code calculates the result then starts a new calculation,</li>
  <li>If users presses "+", "-", "x", "Ã·" operands or "." more than once, code ignores latter click,</li>
  <li> "Â±" and "%" buttons were taken into consideration and they work properly,</li>
  <li>Decimal part of the result is limited by using toFixed method. Total length of the result can't exceed 9,</li>
  <li>When user clicks "=" style of the result changes and becomes a little bigger. In order to change style, I've added and removed a class to respective Div,</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below ðŸ‘‡. Hope you like my project! </li>
</ul>
